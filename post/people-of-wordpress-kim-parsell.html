WordPress enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress changed people’s lives for the better. This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Meet Kim Parsell</strong></h2>



<p>We’d like to introduce you to Kim Parsell. Kim was an active and well-loved member of the WordPress community. Unfortunately, she passed away in 2015. Lovingly referred to as #wpmom, she leaves behind a legacy of service.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How Kim became #wpmom</strong></h2>



<p>In order to understand how highly valued the WordPress community was to Kim Parsell, you have to know a bit about her environment.</p>



<p>Kim was a middle-aged woman who lived off a dirt road, on top of a hill, in Southern rural Ohio. She was often by herself, taking care of the property with only a few neighbors up and down the road.</p>



<p>She received internet access from towers that broadcast wireless signals, similar to cell phones but at lower speeds.</p>



<h2><strong>Connecting through attending live podcast recordings</strong></h2>



<p>By listening to the regular podcast, WordPress Weekly, Kim met members of the WordPress community and was able to talk to them on a weekly basis. The show and its after-hours sessions provided Kim a chance to mingle with the who’s who of WordPress at the time. It helped establish long-lasting relationships that would open up future opportunities for her.</p>



<p>Since she lived in a location where few around her used or had even heard of WordPress, the community was an opportunity for her to be with like-minded people. Kim enjoyed interacting with the community, both online and at WordCamp events, and many community members became her second family, a responsibility she took very seriously.</p>

<h2><strong>One of the first women of WordPress</strong></h2>



<p>Kim is regarded as one of the first “women of WordPress,” investing a lot of her time in women who wanted to break into tech. She worked hard to create a safe environment sharing herself and her knowledge and was affectionately called #wpmom.</p>



<p>She contributed countless hours of volunteer time, receiving “props” for 5 major releases of WordPress, and was active on the documentation team.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;Affectionately called #wpmom, Kim was an investor. She invested countless hours into the WordPress project and in women who wanted to break into tech.&#8221;</em></p><cite><em>Carrie Dils</em></cite></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</strong></h2>



<p>In 2014, she received a travel stipend offered by the WordPress Foundation that enabled her to attend the WordPress community summit, held in conjunction with WordCamp San Francisco. She shared with anyone who would listen, that this was a life-changing event for her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The WordPress Foundation now offers that scholarship in her memory. The Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship provides funding annually for a woman who contributes to WordPress to attend WordCamp US, a flagship event for the WordPress community.</p>



<p>This scholarship truly is a fitting memorial. Her contributions have been vital to the project. Moreover, the way she treated and encouraged the people around her has been an inspiration to many.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Her spirit lives on in the people she knew and inspired. Here’s hoping that the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship will serve to further inspire those who follow in her footsteps.</em></p><cite><em>Drew Jaynes</em></cite></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Kim is missed, but her spirit continues to live on</strong></h2>



<p>Sadly Kim died just a few short months later. But her spirit lives on in the people she knew and inspired within her communities. The Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship will serve to further inspire those who follow in her footsteps.</p>
