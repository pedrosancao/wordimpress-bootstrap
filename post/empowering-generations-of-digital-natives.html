                    <p>Technology is changing faster each year. Digital literacy can vary between ages but there are lots of ways different generations can work together and empower each as digital citizens.</p>



<p>No matter whether youâ€™re a parent or caregiver, teacher or mentor, itâ€™s hard to know the best way to teach younger generations the skills needed to be an excellent digital citizen. If youâ€™re not confident about your own tech skills, you may wonder how you can help younger generations become savvy digital citizens. But using technology responsibly is about more than just technical skills. By collaborating across generations, you can also strengthen all your family membersâ€™ skills, and offer a shared understanding of what the internet can provide and how to use it to help your neighborhoods and wider society.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2>Taking Gen Z Beyond Digital Savvy</h2>



<h3>Open up the dialogue</h3>



<p>Even if youâ€™re not fully confident in your own tech skills, you can help develop digital citizenship skills in others. If you feel comfortable during everyday conversation, you could describe a tech situation you have come across and ask family members if they have ever experienced something similar. You can give them a chance to share how they handled it or how it made them feel. This can help encourage them to think critically and to react with empathy. And being asked for advice can make them feel appreciated and empowered. But opening up the conversation can also be as simple as asking if theyâ€™ve seen anything online lately that they found interesting or wanted to talk about.</p>



<h3>Share access to free and affordable training</h3>



<p>Open source content management systems have made online publishing accessible to a more diverse group of people. Dozens of content platforms offer hands-on training at no or low cost. <a href="https://wordpress.tv/">WordPress.tv</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/wordpress">LinkedIn Learning</a>, and others have low-cost video libraries with thousands of recorded talks and workshops and the WordPress Training team have excellent downloadable lesson plans and materials. These platforms not only feature content that helps develop tech and content creation skills but also content around ethics, diversity and community building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Find a sense of community and belonging</h3>



<p>One of the disadvantages of increased digitalization is that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">younger generations and us all may spend less time hanging out in-person.</a> Digital time spent with others is no replacement for in-person interactions. The awareness and mutual understanding which comes from back and forth interaction is needed for positive interpersonal skills. This is hard to replace in digital communities and those skills can only be learned with lots of hands-on practice.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Learn the many benefits of volunteering&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are WordPress events across the world that provide a great place to learn new skills to share with your families and friends. Some work with schools and colleges to offer special events which are open to all ages. There are also plenty of small ways to volunteer with the WordPress project that can be done at home to practice new skills.</p>



<p>In addition to attending events where you can learn skills and hang out with others with similar interests, the WordPress ecosystem offers countless opportunities to be actively involved. Professionals, hobbyists, and learners all make a difference by contributing to the ongoing creation of the WordPress platform. Together these people, who are known as contributors, form the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">WordPress open source community.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>WordPress is created by volunteer contributors</h4>



<p>Not only are these contributors creating an amazingly flexible platform for all to use, it is an environment where you can continue to improve your skills, both technical and interpersonal. Open-source software projects can introduce you to people you would otherwise not get the chance to meet, locally and internationally. If you have a zest for learning, and for finding others to connect with, WordPress has many ways to meet contributors in person!</p>



<h4>WordPress events are organized by volunteers</h4>



<p>WordPress community events are volunteer-run. This can be a great way to give back to the project and practice all sorts of skills. Talk to your local event about how you could get involved and if you would like to bring older teenagers and young adults with you. You will not need any pre-existing tech skills to attend these events but they are a great way to discover areas you might want to learn more about.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Contributor days offer a great opportunity to get involved</h4>



<p>These events are specially designed to help you get involved in building the open-source WordPress platform. You can collaborate with other members of its community and find areas that are right for you to use and grow your skills. All of the tasks you will discover at an event can be continued at home and some are easy to get other family members involved in learning and adding in ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contributors come from all sorts of backgrounds and locations, some may live near you and others thousands of miles away. Working alongside lots of different cultures and countries can open up new ideas for young people letting them learn new ways of doing things and discover different perspectives. All those different perspectives can cause misunderstandings. But being involved in a global learning community is a great way to practice communicating across cultural boundaries.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Getting involved can be rewarding in many (unexpected) ways</h4>



<p>The most rewarding part of actively taking part in WordPress events is making budding friendships. New connections often turn into long-lasting friendships that are likely to continue for years to come, both online and offline. With a global community, these friendships can potentially lead to lots of international adventures too!</p>

<h3>Make our digital world safer and more inclusive</h3>



<p>Befriending people from a wide variety of cultures and backgrounds can be an enriching experience in itself. It can also help you make us make more informed decisions. The more we interact with a diverse range of people, the more empathic we become. Some of the most valuable learning that can be offered to Gen Z (and probably to all of us at times) is that what we come across in fast-moving digital communities isnâ€™t always the entire view.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>All things consideredâ€¦.</h2>



<p>Anyone who is a digital native may not need encouragement to obtain tech skills. But they may not be aware that digital communities are still communities and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/responsible-participation-in-online-communities/">we need to use the same sorts of people skills for both offline and online locations</a>. Opening up conversations about situations they may experience online that may require them to (re)act responsibly, can encourage them to think critically and act with empathy. Compared to previous generations, digital natives spend substantially more time by themselves while using devices, so encouraging them to join real-life communities, such as WordPress, could be the first step to learning what it means to be a good digital citizen!&nbsp; </p>
