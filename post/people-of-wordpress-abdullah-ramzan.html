                    <p><em>You’ve probably heard that WordPress is open-source software, and may know that it’s created and run by volunteers. WordPress enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress changed people’s lives for the better. This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Meet Abdullah Ramzan, from Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.</strong></h2>



<p>Abdullah Ramzan was born and brought up in the under-developed city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layyah"><strong>​Layyah​</strong></a>, which is situated in Southern Punjab, Pakistan and surrounded by desert and the river ​Sindh​.</p>



<p>He graduated from college in his home town and started using a computer in ​2010​ when he joined <a href="https://gcuf.edu.pk/"><strong>​Government College University Faisalabad​</strong></a>. Abdullah’s introduction to WordPress happened while he was finishing the last semester of his degree. His final project was based in WordPress.</p>



<p>Ramzan’s late mother was the real hero in his life, helping him with his Kindergarten homework and seeing him off to school every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before her heart surgery, Ramzan visited her in the hospital ICU, where she hugged him and said: ​“<strong>Don’t worry, everything will be good</strong>.” Sadly, his mother died during her surgery. However, her influence on Ramzan’s life continues.</p>



<h3><strong>Start of Ramzan’s Career:</strong></h3>



<p>After graduation, Ramzan struggled to get his first job. He first joined PressTigers<strong>​</strong> as a Software Engineer and met Khawaja Fahad Shakeel<a href="https://twitter.com/FahadShakeel"><strong>​</strong></a>, his first mentor. Shakeel provided Ramzan with endless support. Something had always felt missing in his life, but he felt like he was on the right track for the first time in his life when he joined the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Community – WordCamps and Meetups:</strong></h3>



<p>Although Ramzan had used WordPress since ​2015​, attending WordPress meetups and open source contributions turned out to be a game-changer for him. He learned a lot from the WordPress community and platform, and developed strong relationships with several individuals. One of them is <a href="https://twitter.com/jainnidhi03"><strong>​</strong></a>Nidhi Jain​ from Udaipur India who he works with on WordPress development. The second is <a href="https://twitter.com/desrosj"><strong>​</strong></a>Jonathan Desrosiers​ who he continues to learn a lot from.</p>



<p>In addition, Usman Khalid<a href="https://twitter.com/Usman__Khalid"><strong>​</strong></a>, the lead organizer of WC Karachi, mentored Ramzan, helping him to develop his community skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the mentorship of these contributors, Ramzan is confident supporting local WordPress groups and helped to organize ​WordCamp Karachi​, where he spoke for the first time at an international level event. He believes that WordPress has contributed much to his personal identity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>WordPress and the Future:</strong></h3>



<p>As a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Lahore/members/?op=leaders&amp;sort=name"><strong>​co-organizer of WordPress Meetup Lahore,​</strong></a> he would love to involve more people in the community leadership team, to provide a platform for people to gather under one roof, to learn and share something with each other. </p>



<p>But he has loftier ambitions. Impressed by <a href="https://walktowc.eu/">Walk to WordCamp Europe</a>, Abdullah is seriously considering walking to WordCamp Asia. He also one day hopes for the opportunity to serve his country as a senator of Pakistan<a href="http://www.senate.gov.pk/"><strong>​</strong></a> and intends to enter the next senate election.</p>



<h3><strong>Words of Encouragement</strong></h3>



<p>Abdullah Ramzan knows there is no shortcut to success. “You have to work hard to achieve your goals,” explained Ramzan. He still has much he wishes to accomplish and hopes to be remembered for his impact on the project.</p>



<p>Abdullah believes WordPress can never die as long as people don’t stop innovating to meet new demands. The beauty of WordPress is that it is made for everyone.</p>



<p>Ramzan encouraged, “If you seriously want to do something for yourself, do something for others first. Go for open source, you’ll surely learn how to code. You’ll learn how to work in a team. Join local meetups, meet with the folks: help them, learn from them, and share ideas.”</p>
